# Hi, this software is currently in development.

It is trying to be a valid open source alternative of the one seen at the end of Glarses' video 'How To Make Any Keyboard Sound AMAZING' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_9vXJZVT54

If you want to try it you have to include a 'sound pack', you can find Glarses' one in his video description: download it and unzip it in the 'audio' folder

## Known bugs
1- Playsound library does not close files after playing them causing crashes  
2- There needs to be an unknown.extension file  
3- holding a key repeats the sound
